/**
 * Created by Rebecca Tang on 2/20/19.
 *
 * quick script to flatten and take tally of file directory
 * This script is not as polished as other scripts
 *
 * sourceDir is a directory that has sub directories
 * flatDir is the directory to copy all the files from the sourceDir to, not preserving sub directory structure
 * It will print out at the end how many files are copied.  The types of files that are copied and how many for each type.
